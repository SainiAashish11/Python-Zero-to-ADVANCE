# Python-Zero-to-ADVANCE
In this Repository, I've covered all the basics to ADVANCE Python syntax and concepts having proper indentation, examples and comments for better re-view

Suggestions for better and clear learning through this repository :
1 - Go through each and every concept and it's code in sequence for clear concept building, 
2 - Write code on your own during your overall learning process, 
3 - Try to write your own examples after understanding examples and comments provided in the code snippets, 
4 - Last but not least : 
                        List_Practice = ["Practice" , "Practice" , "Practice" ]
                             for Practice in Practice :
                                 print(Practice)
